    The Post Impressionists were a few independent artists at the end of the 19th century who rebelled against the limitations of Impressionism to develop a range of personal styles that influenced the development of art in the 20th century. The major artists associated with Post Impressionism were Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Vincent Van Gogh and Georges Seurat.

Cézanne was an important influence on Picasso and Braque in their development of Cubism. Van Gogh&#039;s vigorous and vibrant painting technique was one of the touchstones of both Fauvism and Expressionism, while Gauguin&#039;s symbolic color and Seurat&#039;s pointillist technique were an inspiration to Les Fauves.</div>

The painting was executed on industrial primed canvas of size 30 (French standard). It depicts the interior of the cafe, with a half-curtained doorway in the center background leading, presumably, to more private quarters. Five customers sit at tables along the walls to the left and right, and a waiter in a light coat, to one side of a pool table near the center of the room, stands facing the viewer. The five customers depicted in the scene have been described as "three drunks and derelicts in a large public room [...] huddled down in sleep or stupor." One scholar wrote, "The cafe was an all-night haunt of local down-and-outs and prostitutes, who are depicted slouched at tables and drinking together at the far end of the room." In wildly contrasting, vivid colours, the ceiling is green, the upper walls red, the glowing, gas ceiling lamps and floor largely yellow. The paint is applied thickly, with many of the lines of the room leading toward the door in the back. The perspective looks somewhat downward toward the floor."><img src="../../attachments/artwork_113_thumb.jpg" alt="The Night Café" /></a>       </div>

Against the Enamel of a Background Rhythmic with Beats and Angles, Tones, and Tints, Portrait of M. Félix Fénéon in 1890. Felix Fénéon was an art dealer, collector, curator, political activist, critic, and friend of Signac who shared the artist's interests in science and Japanese prints. In this painting Signac depicts this unconventional and enigmatic personality with his characteristic goatee, holding a top hat and a walking stick in one hand and a flower in the other. Combining figuration and abstraction, he sets Fénéon's static profile against a swirling background—a kaleidoscopic depiction of optical theorist Charles Henry's recently published color wheel. A similar playfulness underlies the exceedingly long title, possibly a spoof on scientific terminology. "><img src="../../attachments/artwork_19_thumb.jpg" alt="Portrait of M.

With each version of the bathers, Cézanne moved away from the traditional presentation of paintings, intentionally creating works which would not appeal to the novice viewer. He did this in order to avoid fleeting fads and give a timeless quality to his work, and in so doing paved the way for future artists to disregard current trends and paint pieces which would appeal equally to all generations.The abstract nude females present in Large Bathers give the painting tension and density. It is exceptional among his work in symmetrical dimensions, with the adaption of the nude forms to the triangular pattern of the trees and river. Using the same technique as employed in painting landscapes and still lifes, Large Bathers is reminiscent of the work of Titian and Peter Paul Rubens. Comparisons are also often made with the other famous group of nude women of the same period, Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon."><img src="../../attachments/artwork_112_thumb.jpg" alt="Les Grandes Baigneuses" /></a>        </div>

Since 1941 it has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Reproduced often, the painting is widely hailed as his magnum opus. The center part shows the village of Saint-Rémy under a swirling sky, in a view from the asylum towards north. The Alpilles far to the right fit to this view, but there is little rapport of the actual scene with the intermediary hills which seem to be derived from a different part of the surroundings, south of the asylum. The cypress tree to the left was added into the composition. Of note is the fact van Gogh had already, during his time in Arles, repositioned Ursa Major from the north to the south in his painting Starry Night Over the Rhone."><img src="../../attachments/artwork_114_thumb.jpg" alt="Starry Night" /></a>       </div>

            <a href="../../attachments/artwork_115.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[movement_10]" title="<br /><p><br />Bathers at Asnières<br />1884-1884<br />Oil on Canvas<br />National Gallery, London<br />The Bathers at Asnières is the first of his two masterpieces on the monumental scale. Seurat borrowed from sources such as those of the fresco painters of the 15th century, the French classicism of Nicolas Poussin, and of contemporary Impressionism to create a unified canvas of a suburban, but placid Parisian riverside scene. The isolated figures and their clothes piled sculpturally on the riverbank, together with the trees, and austere boundary walls and buildings, are presented in a formal layout. A combination of complex brushstroke techniques, and a meticulous application of contemporary colour theory bring to the composition a sense of gentle vibrancy and timelessness. The spot depicted is just short of five miles from the centre of Paris. It is in fact the case that the figures on the river-bank are not in the commune of Asnières, but are rather in Courbevoie, the commune bordering Asnières to the west. The bathers themselves are in the River Seine. The slope forming most of the left hand side of the painting was known as the Côte des Ajoux, near the end of the rue des Ajoux, on the north bank of the river. Opposite is the island of la Grande Jatte, the east tip of which is shown as the slope and the trees to the right, and which Seurat has pictorially extended beyond its actual length. The Asnières railway bridge, and the industrial buildings of Clichy are in the background. Locations such as this one were sometimes shown on French nineteenth century maps as Baignade (or, ‘bathing area’)."><img src="../../attachments/artwork_115_thumb.jpg" alt="Bathers at Asnières" /></a>     </div>

The pale colors of these seascapes convey the intensity of the Mediterranean sun, whose light, as described by the artist, "discolors the shadows, attenuates the local colors, and washes out the pure sky."

        <span style="display: block;">1910-1910</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 13px; ">The Bloomsbury Group’s most direct contribution to the change in human character that Virginia Woolf analyzes in "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown" was the first Post-Impressionist Exhibition, “Manet and the Post-Impressionists” (1910). The exhibition focused on the work of Cézanne, Van Gogh, and Gauguin, but also attempted to outline a trajectory from Manet down to the most recent “post-impressionists,” Matisse and Picasso, who were both represented in the exhibition. 

Most British art critics in 1910 were still trying to digest the impressionism of Monet and Renoir, and the new exhibition, by rejecting impressionism as old-fashioned, baffled even sympathetic observers. E. M. Forster wrote that “Gauguin and Van Gogh were too much for me.”[1] Many viewers and critics thought the show a hoax or an offense against English culture. The art historian Charles Harrison has listed some of the words applied to the exhibition: “horror,” “madness,” “infection,” “sickness of the soul,” “putrescence,” “pornography,” “anarchy” and “evil.”[2] A few, however, defended the exhibition, and the consummate Edwardian Arnold Bennett suggested that the scorn heaped on modern art by the British public showed “that London is infinitely too self-complacent even to suspect that it is London and not the exhibition which is making itself ridiculous.”[3]

The champions of modernity in art shared Bennett’s sense that London was woefully behind the times. English artists soon began to absorb the influences of Matisse and the early, pre-cubist Picasso. A second Post-Impressionist Exhibition in 1912 displayed paintings by Bloomsbury artists like Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell alongside works 
by the major French painters and a number of rather obscure Russians.</span>

The show was all about the French painter Edouard Manet and his post-impressionist work of arts. The exhibition also had works of other young artists of works post-impressionism.</span>
